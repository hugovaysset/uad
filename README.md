Module that contains recurrent functions and classes used in the study on unsupervised anomaly detection using deep learning techniques.

* ```models``` contains all the deep learning models recurrently used, grouped by type (autoencoder, variational autencoder) in single
files
* ```diagnostic``` contains the functions to compute metrics on predictions, or data visualisation.
* ```callbacks``` contains the callabcks used during models training
* ```MNIST``` contains the functions to load data and set anomalies on it.
* ```CIFAR10```contains the functions to load CIFAR data.
