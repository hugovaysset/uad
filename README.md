Module that contains recurrent functions and classes used in the study on unsupervised anomaly detection using deep learning techniques.
- ```models``` contains all the deep learning models recurrently used, grouped by type (autoencoder, variational autencoder) in single
files
- ```metrics``` contains the functions to compute metrics on predictions
- ```MNIST``` contains utility functions (usually plot functions) used in the particular study on MNIST digits
